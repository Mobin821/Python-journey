# Python-journey
I am starting out in Python and would like to keep a journal of my project here.
Print('Hello, world') #print is a function, and the "Hello, world" is an argument
import sys #sys is a built-in module that contains many system information, in order to use we must import it
print(sys.version) #this function allows us to get the version of python installed
